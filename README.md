# VisuProject
 The software application for 3-axis robot control uses a custom circuit unit with a Raspberry Pi including motor control and other electronics, to control the machine. The program offers advanced visualization with Pyside and OpenGl, GPIO emulation, coordinate guidance, and touchscreen compatibility. It has been optimized for performance using the Cython programming language and is currently under development. It has been tested on Windows (only for visualization) and Raspberry Pi OS (Linux).
